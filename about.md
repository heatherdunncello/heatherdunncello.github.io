		<p>Heather Dunn is a classically trained cellist.  In high school, she placed third in the 1994 ASTA Alaska State Solo competition, learned the foundations of accompaniment and upright bass technique in fiddle club, and played with the ASTA All State and All Northwest Orchestras.  In college, she focused strongly on small ensemble performance and music theory at the University of Puget Sound.  There, she laid down her first studio tracks with experimental pop band, Caiaphas, led by bassist CJ Boyd.</p>
		<p>She was a founding member of world folk music band Samarkand, has played with singer-songwriter Elizabeth Hummel’s band Waterwitch, the Irish band Pinniped, and the eclectic acoustic band Farthing Pig. She's currently working on projects with folk dancers and sitting in with a jazz manouche group. Check out her social media on <a href="{{ site.socials.Instagram }}">Instagram</a> and <a href="{{ site.socials.Facebook }}">Facebook</a> for a sample of folk tunes.</p>
		<p>As a teacher with twelve years of experience, Heather delights in recognizing what you’re doing right and demonstrating that the next level of playing is within reach. She focuses on building strong technique, expressive musicality, and helping students discover how to play in the genres they love the most. Her students have gone on to receive a cello scholarship at Pacific Lutheran University and to play in community orchestras in Washington State, Alaska, and New Mexico.</p>
