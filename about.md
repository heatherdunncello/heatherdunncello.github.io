		<p>Heather Dunn is a classically trained cellist.  In high school she placed third in the 1994 ASTA Alaska State Solo competition, learned the foundations of accompaniment and upright bass technique in fiddle club and attended All Northwest Orchestra.  In college, she focused strongly on small ensemble performance and Music Theory at the University of Puget Sound.  There, she laid down her first studio tracks with experimental pop band, Caiaphas, led by bassist CJ Boyd.</p>
		<p>She was a founding member of world folk music band Samarkand, has played with singer-songwriter Elizabeth Hummel’s band Waterwitch, and the Irish band Pinniped. These days can catch her performing with the eclectic Captain Heather and the See-Worthies, or find her folk tunes as the Interloping Cellist on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.</p>
		<p>As a teacher with seven years experience, Heather delights in recognizing what you’re doing right, and demonstrating that the next level of playing is within reach. She focuses on building strong technique, expressive musicality, and helping students discover how to play in the genres they love the most. Her students have gone on to receive a cello scholarship at Pacific Lutheran University and to serve as Associate Principal cellist of the Anchorage Civic Orchestra.</p>
