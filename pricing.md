		<h4>Lesson Expectations</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Students will arrive early, prepared with necessary sheet music, tuned instrument, and other supplies.</li>
		<li>Late students will have their lesson end at the normal time, and be charged for a full-length lesson.  Students who miss a lesson with less than 24 hours notice will be charged for a full-length lesson. Students without the expected equipment will be sent home and be charged for a full-length lesson.</li>
		<li>If a lesson must be skipped, please let me know by 9 AM the morning of the lesson.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Practice Expectations</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Students taking 30-minute lessons weekly should practice 30 minutes a day, 4-5 days a week.</li>
		<li>Students taking 1-hour lessons should practice 45-60 minutes a day, 5-6 days a week.</li>
		<li>Students are responsible for renting or buying their own music, instrument, and other supplies.</li>
		<li>Students are expected to prepare their assignments.  This is your homework! Being unprepared for your lesson is a waste of your time and mine.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Teacher Expectations</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>My job is to make an effort to understand your music goals, create a plan to help you achieve them, and to believe 100% in your ability to succeed.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Good Practice Habits</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Good practice is structured like a good lesson; it opens with a warm-up, then scales/arpeggios, etude book work, then a performance piece.</li>
		<li>This ensures the studentâ€™s body and brain are ready to make the best use of practice time, and keeps them capable of progressing at a noticeable, satisfying rate.</li>
		<li>Whether working on a scale, etude, or performance piece it is best to play through the selection entirely once, and circle problem passages in pencil. Then one can isolate the problem and resolve it, either through creating an improved fingering strategy, or practice.  This may mean repeating two notes until they can be played five times through without mistake, then expanding the scope into the surrounding several measures, then integrating it into the larger selection or piece.</li>
		</ul>
